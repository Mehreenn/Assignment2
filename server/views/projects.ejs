          I've worked on the Software System Requirements Document in a group of four where we came up with an appropriate application needed today. 
          It was a car park application. We defined its specifications such as hardware and software interfaces through which we formed various use cases, determined functional and non-functional requirements and detailed class diagrams.
          The primary goal of this application is to assist its users in locating their chosen parking places selected through the parking application. The end-user must enter their preferences, 
          which the application then processes and leads them to a suitable parking place. As they filter through numerous parking demands, the end-user's convenience and care is emphasised. 
          The project was successfully completed on time and received a high grade. Through this I learned how to work with a team and collaborate to build an effective Software System Requirements Document.

          As part of my semester 2 assignment, I also created an interactive Weather Application. To create a dynamic weather app, we learnt how to interact with APIs, 
          or Application Programming Interfaces. OpenWeatherMap is a service provider that collects, organises, and analyses meteorological and other pertinent weather 
          data before making it available through API. The application requested our current position and displayed a map of our current location. After requesting the 
          user for a city name, the application could also provide data such as Wind Speed, Latitude, Longitude, and Temperature. The application presented the complete 
          information for our current location with the same approach. It was a fun learning experience.

          Another object oriented programming language that was covered in my semester was C#. We have done several activities to learn how to work with the language.
          One such activity was learning how to build interactive windows forms application. This was concentrated on using Graphical User Interface to interact We have also worked out how to deal with interfaces and json files.
          Other things I learned include using collections, serializimg and deserializing data and implementing polymorphism.
          The programming language was all about learning how to design, code and document object oriented programs.
